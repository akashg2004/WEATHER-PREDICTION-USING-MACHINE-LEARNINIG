# WEATHER-PREDICTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNINIG
To train a machine learning model using experimental datasets to predict weather  such density, humidity, temperature, and air quality as a function of vertical Datetime. Predict the weather conditions in the form of a graph by the use of weather data collected by IOT devices and pre-collected data.
